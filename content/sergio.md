## Bio:
After living in Mexico for 16 years, I had to leave my family behind to begin a new journey in the United States. 
Now, as a microbiology and biochemistry student-researcher, I am continuing my path to provide assistance to the 
communities that surround Oklahoma State University. Now, as part of the IQ BIO REU in the Univesristy of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras,
I will explore the tools and insights of bioinformatics and data analysis.

## Research Abstract

The rhizosphere region is a thin layer around the plant root, which is composed of microbial communities, 
plant cells, and root secretions. Rhizosphere communities from similar niches and variants in geologies 
have shown to impact the composition and plant phenotype (1).  Methodologies conducted to process metagenomics 
begin by relying on pre-filtering steps of redundant, low quality sequences, and assembly of contigs (2).
In (2) the authors claim that metagenomic research is computationally constrained, and novel algorithms
and techniques must be developed to further the field. Recent advancements have introduced k-mer based
sequence analysis. k-mer analysis was developed to overcome time constraints of traditional assembly strategies (3).
The purpose of this study is to explore the changes in composition of microbiota from previously published
rhizosphere communities by k-mer based sequence analysis. It will consist of analyzing the metagenomic
data from the Tabebuia heterophylla rhizosphere communities from different geological substrates.
This project hopes to find and provide further understanding of the key differences in the
Tabebuia heterophylla rhizosphere communities.
