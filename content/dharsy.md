## Bio

Social Sciences student-researcher at Computer Sciences Department. IDGeNe student program at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus. During the time I will be working with my peers and the Profesor in Bioinformatic of gene expression.

## Research Goals

To combine social sciences, public health (Geentics Epidemiology) with cutting-edge biological research.

## Research Abstract

During the expression of genes in tissues there is cell heterogeneity which causes a massive amount of voluminous information about the normal cells and anomalous cells. Bioinformatics is a field that can provide tools to analyze large data sets. In bioinformatics, computer technology is the main protagonist, it helps to analyze and translate biological data.  Hence, we will be using this field to evaluate the differential expression in cancer tissues of humans, using publicly available datasets. We selected samples of homo sapiens colon colorectal tumor core, and adjacent non-malignant colon tissue to study. Our goal is to identify gene patterns, with this in mind the method that will be used to process the data is Binarization, especially the Binary Differential Analysis (BDA). The Binary Differential Analysis has the advantage of reproducibility of data, it reduces the amount of information and detects biologically relevant genes. BDA collects the genes that were expressed as a non-zero value which was assigned a one, if the gene did not express it will be a zero value.
